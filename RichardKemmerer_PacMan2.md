# IndividualProjectProposal
  Pac-Man 2.0

## Each project proposal contains:

  Lots of people, including myself, spent a lot of their childhood playing video games. One of the most iconic arcade games of all time, is Pac-Man. 
  
  This proposal is linked to the educational goals of this class. This project will continue to expand my knowledge on how to use Github. It will teach me how to collaborate and improve on someone else's project. The project will help me solve issues, test code, and use good time management.
  
  I found an open source project of the classic game of Pac-Man. Currently this game has one level and does not have chase mode. Chase mode is when Pac-Man eats an energizer and can eat the ghosts for a temporary time like he eats the dots. I want to create a unique version of Pac-Man while still including its most basic elements. I want to create new levels with challenging new mazes. I want to add new power ups and new enemies who will try to kill Pac-Man.
