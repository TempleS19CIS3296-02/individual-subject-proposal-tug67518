# IndividualProjectProposal

## Each project proposal contains:

- A one paragraph description of the overall project
- A one paragraph explanation of how the proposal is linked to the educational goals of this class and why this goal is important goal (see list of subject in Initial Survey or slide 7 and 8 in CIS3296Introduction.pptx).
- A one paragraph description of your proposed contribution
- A URL reference to the project

Note: contributing to an open-source project is preferred. You may propose a stand-alone project, but if you do, it must be submitted as an open-source project.

Note: in picking an open-source project you should down-load the source and make sure that you can build the code before committing to use it in your project.

Note: this is an individual assignment all students have to come with a personal proposal.  Teams will be formed later to work on a selection of the more interesting proposals. 

## What to submit
Create two new files named **YourName_ProjectTitle.md** and **YourName_ProjectTitle.png** for your proposal. Use [StellaOwl_PayStation.md](StellaOwl_Paystation.md) as a template.
